Hello there techie ninjas, I hope you are doing well. We have started the new Series "Exploring Java 8", Here we would be learning all the things which are making a buzz in the programming world. 
Since Java 8, java is moving in the direction towards the declarative programming approach from the imperative programming approach. 
If you are not aware of what is imperative programming and what is declarative programming. 
It is the way you write code. 

### So what you are going to learn in this series ?
* Lambda in Java
* Functional Interfaces
* Method and Constructor Reference
* Streams API
* Optionals
* New Date/Time API

### Few words about Imperative vs Declarative Programming

* [Declarative Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming) is style of building the structure and elements of computer programming that express the logic of computiaon without describing its flow.
* Many languages that apply this style attempt to minimize or eliminate side effects by describing what the program must accomplish in terms of the problem domain, rather than describe how to accomplish it as a sequence of the programming language primitives.
* functional programming is sub-paradime of declarative programming
* [Imperative programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming) is a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program's state. Imperative programming focuses on describing how a program operates.
* Procedural programming is a type of imperative programming in which the program is built from one or more procedures (also termed subroutines or functions)


Thats all for the theory, Lets get our hand dirty with the code. See you all in next lessons.
